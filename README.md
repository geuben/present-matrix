## Present Matrix Python Flask App for Google App Engine

A very simple app to determine who should buy presents for who.

Takes a comma separated list of names and the number of presents people are going to buy. eg A,B,C 2 presents

Returns something like:

A buys for B, C
B buys for C, A
C buys for A, B
